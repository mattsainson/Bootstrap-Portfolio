                            <p>I was born in New Jersey, moved to CA when I was 15, and I've lived in the Sacramento
                                area ever since. I graduated from Sacramento State University with a B.A. in
                                Mathematics but while a student started developing solutions in FileMaker Pro, and
                                learning how to administer networks and servers.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Professionally, I've worked for the State of CA, a technology startup, started my own
                                technology company, contracted with various companies, and currently work for a bio
                                tech company that makes immune system diagnostic kits. I've primarily used a software
                                environment called 4D but I'm most interested in web and mobile development.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In the late 1990's I had an opportunity to do a software project for the CA State Fair
                                Commercial Wine Competition. While there, I met some folks that were home winemakers
                                and started making wine. More recently, I started making beer, in particular IPAs. I've
                                worked with a number of commercial wineries in the area, picking, crushing, pressing,
                                and bottling. I've even managed a vineyard for a couple of years.  I've been a member of the
                                Sacramento Home Winemakers for several years, and served on their board for one year.
